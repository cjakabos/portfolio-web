</p>
Welcome to my dynamic portfolio, showcasing cutting-edge projects from my Web Development and Predictive Analytics Nanodegrees. This repository is packed with full-stack solutions, ranging from microservices to interactive front-end interfaces and robust data analytics models.

## What's Inside?

- **CloudApp - Interactive Next.js 14 App Shell and Micro Frontend**: Experience the sleek Next.js interface designed to interact seamlessly with the backend services.  [Explore the frontend](./frontend/cloudapp-shell/README.md).
    - A micro frontend setup with an app shell solution to enable independently deployable front-end modules, improving scalability and maintainability. [Check details](#4-maps-with-vehicle-locations)
- **Microservices Architecture**: Dive into backend API services crafted during my Nanodegree. More about backend services: [cloudapp](./backend/cloudapp/README.md), [petstore](./backend/petstore/README.md), [vehicles-api](./backend/vehicles-api/README.md), [jira-proxy](./backend/web-proxy/README.md).
- **Load Balancer and Reverse Proxy**: Utilize Nginx to efficiently distribute traffic among servers and enhance performance and reliability of applications.   [Read more](https://www.nginx.com).
- **Advanced ML Pipeline**: Leverage my Python-based machine learning pipeline for dynamic customer segmentation, developed during my Predictive Analytics Nanodegree. [See ML details](./backend/ml-pipeline/README.md).
- **Locally hosted LLM with Ollama**: Deploy and interact with a locally hosted LLM using Ollama, featuring a configurable model setup. In this case, Deepseek R1 was used to provide AI-driven insights while maintaining full control over data privacy and performance. [Details on LLM integration](#5-private-local-llm-ai)
- **Integrated External APIs**: Enhance functionality with third-party services like Jira through customized proxy APIs to navigate CORS issues. [Details on API integration](#6-jira).
- **Real-Time Kafka Chat**: Engage with the Kafka-powered chat application, demonstrating real-time messaging capabilities. [Chat interface](#8-chat).
- **Efficient Logging and CI/CD**: Implement robust logging with Log4j and streamline deployments using Jenkins. [Learn about CI/CD processes](backend/cloudapp/README.md#cicd-with-jenkins).

## Quick Start

### Setup with Docker
Note: minimum 16 GB RAM and 35 GB disk space is needed to make sure all services can run.
```bash
brew install docker
brew install docker-compose
```

Setup and start databases and esential services with docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-infrastructure.yml up -d
```
Build and start the Java based services, the Python based ml-pipeline and the Next.js based frontend:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-app.yml up -d
```
Note: configure Ollama model to use with LLM_MODEL in docker-compose-infrastructure.yml, in this example it was deepseek-r1 with 1.5B parameter, good enough for local testing purposes.
```dockerfile
  ollama:
    container_name: ollama
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: Dockerfile_OLLAMA
      args:
        LLM_MODEL: 'deepseek-r1:1.5b'
    ports:
      - 11434:11434
```

Runs the app in the production mode.\
Open http://localhost:5001 to view it in your browser. For development mode check [instructions here](./frontend/cloudapp-shell/README.md#option-2-dev-mode).


If everything is correctly started, you should see a login page with optional Dark Mode:

</p>

And you should be able to register and log in, [after starting the backend services, cloudapp is a must, the rest is optional](#2-shop-interface-for-cloudapp-web-store-rest-api-), and see the current front-end of the api integrations from the services above:
