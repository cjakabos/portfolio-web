</p>

## REACT front-end

### Option 1. Out of the box mode:  

  Setup and start databases and essential services with docker-compose:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose-infrastructure.yml up -d
  ```
  Build and start the Java based services, the Python based ml-pipeline and the Next.js based frontend:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose-app.yml up -d
  ```
Note: configure Ollama model to use with LLM_MODEL in docker-compose-infrastructure.yml, in this example it was deepseek-r1 with 1.5B parameter, good enough for local testing purposes.
```dockerfile
  ollama:
    container_name: ollama
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: Dockerfile_OLLAMA
      args:
        LLM_MODEL: 'deepseek-r1:1.5b'
    ports:
      - 11434:11434
```

If everything is working as expected, you should be able to:
- Open [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) for the main Cludapp app-shell to view micro-frontends.
- Open [http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5002) for the OpenMaps micro-frontend.
- Open [http://localhost:5003](http://localhost:5003) for the Jira micro-frontend.
- Open [http://localhost:5333](http://localhost:5333) for the Local LLM AI micro-frontend.
- Open [http://localhost:5005](http://localhost:5005) for the MLOps micro-frontend.
- Open [http://localhost:5006](http://localhost:5006) for the Petstore micro-frontend.

### Option 2. Dev mode:

Install packages and start React front-end from root of cloudapp-shell and /remote microfrontends:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

If everything is correctly started, you should see a login page with optional Dark Mode:
<p align="center">
  <img src="../../examples/1a.png" width="210px" height="150px" />
</p>

And you should be able to register and log in, [after starting the backend services, cloudapp is a must, the rest is optional](#2-cloudapp-api), and see the current front-end of the api integrations from the services above:

# Optional API services

If Jira functionality is to be used, follow the instructions below:

## Jira API key, [how to register](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/free) and [how to get an API key](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)

Two options:
1. Out of the box: edit this in docker-compose-app.yml:
```
#NEXT_PUBLIC_JIRA_DOMAIN: 'https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net'
#NEXT_PUBLIC_JIRA_API_TOKEN: Y3NhYmFqYWthYm-------YOUR-API-KEY------SDA9REUzRjY4N0M=
#NEXT_PUBLIC_JIRA_PROJECT_KEY: 'yourjiraprojectkey'
#NEXT_PUBLIC_JIRA_EMAIL: 'youremail'
```
2. Local run: Add .env file at frontend/remote/jira directory in this format:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_JIRA_DOMAIN = 'https://xxxx.atlassian.net'
NEXT_PUBLIC_JIRA_API_TOKEN = Y3......2edd (note: no single quotation)
NEXT_PUBLIC_JIRA_PROJECT_KEY: 'yourjiraprojectkey'
NEXT_PUBLIC_JIRA_EMAIL: 'youremail'
```
NOTE: the next-frontend Docker image needs to be rebuilt after editing the .env file.
